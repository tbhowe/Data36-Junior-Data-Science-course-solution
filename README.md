# Data36-Junior-Data-Science-course-solution
My solution to the "Junior Data Scientist's First Month" course final project, run by data36.com. 


DESCRITPION:

The task was to produce a report for a fictional travel blog, in which the business funnel was as follows:

- New readers visit the blog.
- They read articles.
- They subscribe to the newsletter.
- They purchase the info products.

The aim was to instruct the fictional blog owner as to how to spend his advertising budget, using a variety of basic data science techniques: segmentation, funnels, cohort anaylsis etc.


Contained in this repository are my solutions to these basic tasks, implemented in Python using the Pandas, Numpy, and Seaborn.
